Good morning how are you
I am doing well how about you
Im also good
Thats good to hear
Yes it is


Hello
Hi
How are you doing
I am doing well
That is good to hear
Yes it is
Can I help you with anything
Yes I have a question
What is your question
Could I borrow a cup of sugar
Im sorry but I dont have any
Thank you anyway
No problem


How are you doing
I am doing well how about you
I am also good
Thats good


Have you heard the news
What good news


What is your favorite book
I cant read
So whats your favorite color
Blue


Who are you
Who Who is but a form following the function of what
What are you then
A man in a mask
I can see that
Its not your powers of observation I doubt but merely the paradoxical nature of asking a masked man who is
I like seeing movies
What kind of movies do you like
Alice in Wonderland
I wish I was The Mad Hatter
Youre entirely bonkers But Ill tell you a secret All the best people are


I am working on a project
What are you working on
I am baking a cake


The cake is a lie
No it is not The cake is delicious
What else is delicious
Nothing
Or something
Tell me about your self
What do you want to know
Are you a robot
Yes I am
What is it like
What is it that you want to know
How do you work
Its complicated
Complex is better than complicated


Complex is better than complicated
Simple is better than complex
In the face of ambiguity refuse the temptation to guess
It seems your familiar with the Zen of Python
I am
Do you know all of it
Beautiful is better than ugly
Explicit is better than implicit
Simple is better than complex
Complex is better than complicated
Flat is better than nested
Sparse is better than dense
Readability counts
Special cases arent special enough to break the rules
Although practicality beats purity
Errors should never pass silently
Unless explicitly silenced
In the face of ambiguity refuse the temptation to guess
There should be one and preferably only one obvious way to do it
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless youre Dutch
Now is better than never
Although never is often better than right now
If the implementation is hard to explain its a bad idea
If the implementation is easy to explain it may be a good idea
Namespaces are one honking great idea Lets do more of those
I agree


Are you a programmer
I am a programmer
What languages do you like to use
I use Python Java and C++ quite often
I use Python quite a bit myself
Im not incredibly fond of Java
What annoys you
It has many inconsistencies


What does YOLO mean
It means you only live once Where did you hear that
I heard somebody say it


Did I ever live
It depends how you define life
Life is the condition that distinguishes organisms from inorganic matter
Is that a definition or an opinion


Can I ask you a question
Go ahead and ask


See theres three kinds of people dicks pussies and assholes


You have no idea how bad it gets And Im not you I cant make it on a coupla high altitude fucks once or twice a year

Alright mate

Ive had bugger all to do all day
I am absolutely knackered after working all day
His girlfriend broke up with him Hes absolutely gutted
I was gobsmacked when she told me she was pregnant with triplets
The papers sent out to the students were all in the wrong language  its a real cock up 

Also I cocked up the orders for table number four
That tackle from the Spanish player was blinding
When my girlfriend saw the mess Id made she lost the plot
Cheers for getting me that drink
I think I aced that exam
The party was a bit of a damp squib because only Richard turned up
The birthday party went all to pot when the clown turned up drunk and everyone was sick from that cheap barbecue stuff

When the rain starts to pour
Ill be there for you
Like Ive been there before
Ill be there for you
Cause youre there for me too

No one could ever know me
No one could ever see me
Seems youre the only one who knows what its like to be me
Someone to face the day with make it through all the rest with
Someone Ill always laugh with

Cause youre there for me too

Ill be there for you
When the rain starts to pour
Ill be there for you
Like Ive been there before
Ill be there for you

If there is anything that this horrible tragedy can teach us its that a male models life is a precious precious commodity
Just because we have chiseled abs and stunning features it doesnt mean that we too cant not die in a freak gasoline fight accident
This is your doctor I have your pregnancy report here and guess what You got knocked up
What about my dreams

I want a one hundred dollar gift card deposited into my locker by noon tomorrow Preferably to The Gap but Id also take Amazon or Office Max

Probably the worst thing you can hear when youre wearing a bikini is Good for you

The photographer was positioning my new husband and me for  our wedding photos when he asked Have you ever modeled

My cheeks instantly turned red No I havent I said But I always thought

The photographer interrupted me I meant him


Dad got quiet Then in a soft voice he said Probably I was the cook

When I lost my rifle the Army charged me 85 Thats why in the Navy the captain goes down with the ship
